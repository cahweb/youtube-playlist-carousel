# youtube-playlist-carousel

A plugin that will display the first few videos from a specific YouTube playlist.

**Note:** This plugin is in a prototype stage, so full carousel features have not yet been implemented, but they're in the works. It's also configured to only work for a specific playlist belonging to the UCF College of Arts & Humanities, but I will probably open that up with a settings menu in the future.
